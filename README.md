Have you ever gone to a resturant and not know how much to tip?  

Tried countless times doing long division on your reciept, because you do not know the percent?

I have and I wanted an easier way to calculate tips I will be giving to different kinds of services, based off how well the
service was they provided 

Save time and save money with a tip calculator.
